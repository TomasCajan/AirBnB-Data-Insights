# AirBnB-Data-Insights

#### Welcome to the Undacity Data Scientist Nanodegree capstone project 1 - a data science blogpost.<br>
This excercise is meant to practice making data driven decisions.<br>
The dataset we're about to analyze is available at    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston/data <br>
Since this dataset was used quite many times, a creative approach was selected to find some non-trivial questions about this dataset and asnwer them using data. <br>

**Scenario :** <br>
Meet Alex, a young Data Scientist, living in Boston, in the Roxbury neighbourhood. Alex is a happy owner of a nice apartment.<br>
Alex is currently planning his vacation. He would like to travel arround the world for full 2 months.<br>
That is quite expensive fun however, even for Alex, so he is trying to figure out, how to reduce the costs of his vacation. He does not really care when he goes for the vacation, for as long as it lasts 2 months.<br>
Alex gets an idea - how about he rents his apartment while he is away, using the AirBnB. The rent could pay good portion of his travel expenses.<br>

You can read about his adventures with AirBnB below.
