# AirBnB-Data-Insights

#### Welcome to the Undacity Data Scientist Nanodegree capstone project 1 - a data science blogpost.<br>
This excercise is meant to practice making data driven decisions.<br>
The dataset we're about to analyze is available at    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston/data <br>
Since this dataset was used quite many times, a creative approach was selected to find some non-trivial questions about this dataset and asnwer them using data. <br>

**Scenario :** <br>
Meet Alex, a young Data Scientist, living in Boston, in the Roxbury neighbourhood. Alex is a happy owner of a nice apartment.<br>
Alex is currently planning his vacation. He would like to travel arround the world for full 2 months.<br>
That is quite expensive fun however, even for Alex, so he is trying to figure out, how to reduce the costs of his vacation. He does not really care when he goes for the vacation, for as long as it lasts 2 months.<br>
Alex gets an idea - how about he rents his apartment while he is away, using the AirBnB. The rent could pay good portion of his travel expenses.<br>

You can read about his adventures with AirBnB below.

You already heard that Alex would like to rent his apartment using AirBnB. However Alex knows nothing about AirBnB and renting at all.<br>
Good thing he's a Data Scientist! He can make the data talk and help him. Alex has 3 questions about the rent that make him curious the most.<br>
Answering them should help in decision making about how and when to rent.
With the Kaggle Boston AirBnB dataset in his hands, Alex is ready to crack the mystery of a successful renting with AirBnB.<br>

#### 3 main questions Alex has before he is ready to rent his apartment :<br>

**Question 1** : When is the optimal time to rent his apartment, for him to make the most money from the rent?

**Question 2** : How are his chances to rent his apartment for full two months compared to apartments in other city neighbourhoods?

**Question 3** : What are the main factors influencing customers, who would rent such apartment? What can he do to improve his chances to attract people or earn more from rent?
